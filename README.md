# 👋 Hi, I'm Sudheendra Peddiraju

I am a Master's student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University at Buffalo (UB-SUNY), currently in my final semester.  
My work focuses on **biometrics, deep learning, and applied AI systems**, especially projects that combine signal processing with modern neural architectures.  
I enjoy building end-to-end machine learning pipelines — from data curation all the way to modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
